# Solutions to the Euler Problems

Welcome to my collection of solutions to the first 20 Project Euler problems. This repository is part of my programming portfolio and showcases my approach to solving algorithmic and mathematical challenges in Python.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a platform offering a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems. Solving these problems enhances algorithmic thinking, mathematical reasoning, and coding proficiency.

[Project Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `problems_1_to_10.py`: Solutions to problems 1 through 10.

- `problems_11_to_20.py`: Solutions to problems 11 through 20.

- `problems_21_to_30.py`: Solutions to problems 21 through 30.

- `utils.py`: Utility functions used in multiple solutions

--

- `problem_eleven_number.txt`: Data file used in problem 11.

- `problem_thirteen_numbers.txt`: Data file used in problem 13.

- `problem_eighteen_triangle.txt`: Data file used in problem 18.

- `problem_twentytwo_names.txt`: Data file used in problem 22.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions locally:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guffington/euler_problems.git
cd euler_problems
```

#### Runs on Python 3!

### Execute a solution:

E.g.:

```bash
python3 problems_1_to_10.py
```

This will print out the solutions to problems 1 through 10 in order.  
Each solution is written within its own named function.  
Comment out the function call (below each function) to stop computing a particular solution.

## Learning Objectives

Through these problems, I aimed to:

- Enhance proficiency in Python.

- Develop efficient algorithms for mathematical challenges.

- Improve problem-solving strategies and debugging skills.

## Future Plans

I intend to continue solving additional Project Euler problems and expand this repository.  
Future updates will include:

- Solutions to problems 21 and beyond.

- Optimizations and refactorings of existing solutions.

- Benchmarking and performance analyses of each solution
